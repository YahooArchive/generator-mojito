### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-mojito from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-mojito
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo mojito
```
